TODO\_CLI.rb

I am @withtwoemms and I have made a simple todo list program that works interactively via the command line. It is an enhancement of a team treehouse (http://teamtreehouse.com) project courtesy of @jseifer.

I will continue to update, but hope someone finds this useful enough to fork :)


\\----------
HOW IT WORKS
\\----------
    > Download the "todo_cli" folder
    > Make sure the three essential files are present:
        - "todo.rb"
        - "todo_list.rb"
        - "todo_item.rb"
    > If you have ruby installed, type "ruby todo.rb" to begin
        - use a privilaged user or "sude ruby..." if you plan on saving your list (I'm still getting acquainted with 'perms' in the ruby File class)
    > Choose option [1] to make a new list
    > Once you've named it, you can choose to add new items to your list by choosing option [2]. You can do this in batch -- i.e. type something, [enter], type something else [enter], etc...
    > There are options to remove items, complete, or "un-complete" them
    > Once you're ready to save your triumphs and goals for another day, you can choose option [6] to save. 



I'v included an example output file called "groceries\_list.txt". Feel free to send me comments or suggestions.
